## 1. Please Fall in Love With Me 

It's been a long time since I've had someone

to hold me, comfort me, go out, and have some fun

I've had my things, had my flings, but all them temporary

Though I'm young I crave a love that's complete

<span style="color:#C12283"
>
Chorus:

<span style="color:#C12283" 
>Honey, I'm begging you to please fall in love with me

<span style="color:#C12283"
>promise me that you won't ever, ever for get me

<span style="color:#C12283"
>I want to hear your favorite songs in a playlist

<span style="color:#C12283"
>made just for me to listen to straight on repeat

<span style="color:#C12283"
>but you only so recognize me

<span style="color:#C12283"
>late at night when the moon has peaked




I've been thinking about you since the minute we met

Known you for 689 days can you do the math

I can write infinite pages about my love for you

for you there's no limit on the amount of things I'd do

<span style="color:#C12283"
>(chorus)


Bridge:

I have lost my sense of pride

trust me, that I can't deny

thinking about you

every minute of everyday

but what can i say

<span style="color:#C12283"
>(chorus)

## 2. Those Nights

Tell me how to feel when I'm alone

teach me my way out of this deep hole

cause I'm here without you in this broken road

that leads me down the memories

and has me trapped with broken wings

while these thoughts of you keep haunting me

<span style="color:#C12283"
>Chorus:

<span style="color:#C12283"
>On those nights, on those nights

<span style="color:#C12283"
>I just need to feel alright

<span style="color:#C12283"
>How can I get through these thoughts of you

<span style="color:#C12283"
>See your eyes in the stars, see your smile in the sky

<span style="color:#C12283"
>Oh you pull me in just like the moon

<span style="color:#C12283"
>I'm running out of things to do to get over you


Tell me how to feel when I'm a mess

what's the way to end this loneliness?

all those times with you I felt so blessed

Now you're gone.. who would've guessed

that someone who claimed to love so deep

would make these tears run down my cheek

while these thoughts of you keep haunting me

<span style="color:#C12283"
>(chorus)

Bridge:

On those nights

I can't help but replay all the tears

On those nights

I can't help but remember the days you were here

On those nights

all I can think of is holding you tight

in my arms.. for the rest of the night

but you're gone, yeah you lied

and now I'm here lonely every damn night.

ohh.. on those nights

<span style="color:#C12283"

## 3. Mess With My Heart

<span style="color:#C12283"
>Chorus:

<span style="color:#C12283"
>why do I always let them mess with my heart

<span style="color:#C12283"
>my heart, my heart

<span style="color:#C12283"
>why do I always let them rip me apart

<span style="color:#C12283"
>apart, apart

<span style="color:C12283"
>and once that they’re gone, I’m never me again

they really just don’t see how bad I’m suffering

how could I possibly let them do this to me

I do this constantly but always fail to see

their true intentions the way they toy with me

like they are kids again and I’m their barbie

but I’m too blind to see that they’re not my Ken

and they will never step up and be real men

<span style="color:#C12283" 
>(chorus) 

they don’t seem to care, they’re bunch of conmen

ready to trick my mind to get me involved with them

but I’m so over them, need me a handyman

one that’ll fix my heart, one that’ll take a stand

tired of feeling nothing but broken

after kiss, every hug

every time I think I fall in love

<span style="color:#C12283"
>(chorus)

Bridge:

my heart may never be the same

after each one of their games

day by day ripped into more pieces

and the level of disappointment increases

now the love left to share decreases

<p style="color:#C12283"> (chorus) </p>


## 4. Selfish

many people tend to let go of the ones they love

feelings aside, putting their love’s happiness above

many people only want the best for their other half

leaving them with nothing but a photograph

but darling please know that I’m not one of them

I guess once I fell for you I became thoughtless


<span style="color:#C12283"
>Chorus:

<span style="color:#C12283"
>So call me selfish

<span style="color:#C12283"
>But I wouldn’t want to see you love anybody else

<span style="color:#C12283"
>Because I love you and I want you all for myself

<span style="color:#C12283"
>Don’t you know that I would give you the world

<span style="color:#C12283"
>All the things I’d do to be your one and only girl

<span style="color:#C12283"
>So call me selfish

<span style="color:#C12283"
>But I wouldn’t want to see the day you leave this city

<span style="color:#C12283"
>Because I love you and I don’t want you to leave me

<span style="color:#C12283"
>Don’t you know that for you I would travel the world

<span style="color:#C12283"
>All the roads I’d take to be your one and only girl

<span style="color:#C12283"
>So call me selfish, yeah call me selfish


sometimes I sit and think how much you mean to me

I’ve got it real bad for you, that I guarantee

want to make you smile, I just want to make you happy

I want to be the only one that can make you feel complete

Oh I know of a word for people like me, it’s egocentric

but how can I not be when a love this good makes me oh so selfish


<span style="color:#C12283"
>(chorus)



Bridge:
Your love has made me crazy

Your love has made me greedy

Your love has made me messy

Your love has made me needy

So call me selfish

Call me selfish

Call me... selfish


<span style="color:#C12283"
>(chorus)


## 5. Misunderstood

Misunderstood are these thoughts I have

Man, can you explain these feelings

Knowing this is love that can't happen

Knowing this is love that just can't be

if only i could express my every thought

if only this was a love, a love that's not wrong

<span style="color:#C12283"
>(chorus)

<span style="color:#C12283"
>For the most misunderstood love of all is forbidden

<span style="color:#C12283"
>when all you feel has to be put away and hidden

<span style="color:#C12283"
>Oh I know, I know you wouldn't understand

<span style="color:#C12283"
>But I never expected these feelings to expand

Misunderstoon when I watch you speak

Man, can you explain these fast heartbeats

Knowing I can't just look into eyes 

Knowing you're not one I can go to when I cry

If only I could express how you move my word

If only I could tell you that you *are* my world

<span style="color:#C12283"
>(chorus)

Bridge:

Misunderstood are the words of a girl

A girl who may never be able to confess

Who may beat around the bush, but not express

A love that causes the most distress

For the love she has for him is forbidden

<span style="color:#C12283"
>(chorus)


## 6. If This Was Love

no disrespect but I must admit

you ruined my life in an instant

unknowingly I fell for you

I should’ve, I should’ve been more distant

June 18th I remember

when I decided I surrender

thought maybe I’d found the one for me

flashed by your smile in a bowling alley

while first impressions are quite deciving

something bout you is just so appeasing


<span style="color:#C12283"
>chorus:

<span style="color:#C12283"
>we’re not together but we act like we are

<span style="color:#C12283"
>but the rush is amazing so far

<span style="color:#C12283"
>baby I wonder baby I wonder

<span style="color:#C12283"
>what things would be like

<span style="color:#C12283"
>if this was love

<span style="color:#C12283"
>if this was love

<span style="color:#C12283"
>if this was love

<span style="color:#C12283"
>love, love

fine line between love and hate it’s true

and I don’t know from which of the two to choose

June 30 I remember

the day felt colder than December

birthday dinner you didn’t show up to

I only wanted to spend that day with you

and while you broke the promise to be there next to me

still managed to forgive your unreliability

<span style="color:#C12283"
>(chorus)

Bridge:

6 months going on and I’m still nothing to you

you say you’re human and that you’ve got a heart too

but darlin I can tell you why I don’t think that’s true

>(chorus)


## 7. Empty Space

Dating back and forth to fill that empty space

Been feeling incomplete since I first saw your face

Now I always feel the need to go out of my way

To find someone, who might actually stay

Texting back and forth, but there’s still that empty space

No one’s really serious, this is a lousy game to play

Because I’m only into 1 and that one is you

But you’ve got someone that you’ve got to be true to


<span style="color:#C12283"
>Chorus:

<span style="color:#C12283"
>Since I’ve met you, nobody compares

<span style="color:#C12283"
>Having trouble finding someone who cares

<span style="color:#C12283"
>It’s like you’ve left me with an empty space

<span style="color:#C12283"
>I’ve got to find the one who can take your place



Dating back and forth to fill that empty space

Been feeling incomplete since I first saw your face

I’ve got nothing but high expectations for love

Cuz you treat her like a queen and that’s all I can think of

Chatting back and forth but am I even into him

I don’t even think that he is ready to commit

But I’m just spending time with every other guy

To see which one could make me feel almost alive

<span style="color:#C12283"
>(chorus)

Bridge:

Like damn, did I really think I could pull this off

To ignore my love for you and replace you like a glove

But I don’t think someone can fill an empty space

That wasn’t meant to be filled by them anyway

So I’ll go ahead and fill it with love for myself

Because it’s what I deserve, not to be put on a shelf

<span style="color:#C12283"
>Chorus #2:

<span style="color:#C12283"
>Since I’ve met me, nobody compares

<span style="color:#C12283"
>I’ve realized there’s nothing better than selfcare

<span style="color:#C12283"
>And now that empty feeling, I no longer wear

<span style="color:#C12283"
>I found a love greater than any, of that I am aware

x 2



## 8. It Could've Been You

you call me to tell me how much you miss me

2am phone calls because you can’t sleep

it hurts you to see him treat me like a queen

he picked up my pieces, now he makes me feel happy

my relationship with him, you should not speak of

because when you had me you never valued my love

now you can’t help but think that

<span style="color:#C12283"
>Chorus:

<span style="color:#C12283"
>it could’ve been you

<span style="color:#C12283"
>it could’ve been you

<span style="color:#C12283"
>it could’ve been, it could’ve been

<span style="color:#C12283"
>it could’ve been you

<span style="color:#C12283"
>it could’ve been you all along, you by my side

<span style="color:#C12283"
>you til the day I die

<span style="color:#C12283"
>it could’ve been, it could’ve been

<span style="color:#C12283"
>it could’ve been you

he makes me feel special and all warm inside

all you knew how to do was make me cry

but those tears are now dry, never felt more alive

side by side, I’ll love him til earth no longer has life

so hang up the phone, don’t call me again

if I remember clearly, you didn’t want to be friends

you don’t know how to live with yourself knowing that

<span style="color:#C12283"
>(chorus)

Bridge:

you can’t just come back with my heart already fixed

sorry you took so long to realize what you missed

but darlin, I’m already his I’m already his

you lost your chance, no more going back to this

just know that

<span style="color:#C12283"
>(chorus)


## 9. Butterflies

My oh my, I guess I should thank you

For making me feel so brand new

My thoughts on love have changed

You’ve given me a whole different view

This is all a whole new sensation

Causing my heart acceleration

<span style="color:#C12283"
>Chorus:

<span style="color:#C12283"
>And my, my world is shaken

<span style="color:#C12283"
>My breath’s been taken

<span style="color:#C12283"
>My body’s numb but I can still feel these butterflies

<span style="color:#C12283"
>Butterflies

<span style="color:#C12283"
>I’ve been feeling nothing but these butterflies

<span style="color:#C12283"
>Butterflies

<span style="color:#C12283"
>Been a while since I last felt these butterflies

My oh my, I guess you should know

I finally look forward to seeing tomorrow

I’m finally not scared of what my future holds

Because I know I won’t be diving in solo

You’ve got a place in me, and I a place in you

And for you there’s nothing that I wouldn’t do

<span style="color:#C12283"
>(chorus)

Bridge:

It’s refreshing to know you’re by my side

The shy little girl no longer has to hide

So much confidence and so much pride

In knowing that you’ll forever be mine

<span style="color:#C12283"
>(chorus)


## 10. When She Learned to Let Go

Young girl raised so beautifully sweet

She’d tend to love a little too intensely

Blinded by her lovely sunrise

He refused to see past her shining light

Young boy raised with hardships

All he needed was companionship

But nothing too serious like a relationship

He failed to love her, he couldn’t commit

Here she realized she needed to cut the strings

<span style="color:#C12283"
>Chorus:

<span style="color:#C12283"
>When she learned to let go

<span style="color:#C12283"
>She could see her potential

<span style="color:#C12283"
>And that there’s no one more special

<span style="color:#C12283"
>Than the person she can be

<span style="color:#C12283"
>And now she can finally breath

<span style="color:#C12283"
>because she is finally free

<span style="color:#C12283"
>When she learned to let go


Young girl learning to spread her wings

Each day more educated on brand new things

She was a smart one, he says

Now he regrets ever letting her walk away

Young boy learning from his mistakes

He didn’t realize how good she was for him

Only she could see his light, though it was dim

She refuses to look back, no returning to him

Here she realized it was good to have cut the strings

<span style="color:#C12283"
>(chorus)



Bridge:

All he did was hurt her

He didn’t love her

All he did was make her cry

So she needed to say goodbye

He didn’t see her worth

Now he’s missing her

<span style="color:#C12283"
>(chorus)
