<h2>10. Butterflies</h2>
<p>My oh my, I guess I should thank you</p>
<p>For making me feel so brand new</p>
<p>My thoughts on love have changed</p>
<p>You’ve given me a whole different view</p>

<h2>12. When She Learned to Let Go</h2>
<p>Young girl raised so beautifully sweet</p>
<p>She’d tend to love a little too intensely</p>
<p>Blinded by her lovely sunrise</p>
<p>He refused to see past her shining light</p>
<p>Young boy raised with hardships</p>
<p>All he needed was companionship</p>
<p>But nothing too serious like a relationship</p>
<p>He failed to love her, he couldn’t commit</p>
