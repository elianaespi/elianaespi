My name is Eliana Espinosa, I am currently a student at [St. Thomas University](https://www.stu.edu), majoring in *Mathematics*.I am 21 years old, I'm a cancer survivor, and I was born in Brooklyn, NY but was raised in Miami, FL. When I am not working or studying I like to write lyrics about different experiences in life. I have been writing for about 3 years  and my best song ideas tend to come to me late at night when I am trying to fall asleep.
