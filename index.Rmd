## About Me

My name is Eliana Espinosa, I am currently a student at [St. Thomas University](https://www.stu.edu), majoring in *Mathematics*.I am 21 years old, I'm a cancer survivor, and I was born in Brooklyn, NY but was raised in Miami, FL. As a Math major, i have worked on several projects with R programming language and you can see them by clicking on the Projects tab. When I am not working or studying I like to write lyrics about different experiences in life. I have been writing for about 3 years  and my best song ideas tend to come to me late at night when I am trying to fall asleep.

## Musical Inspirations

Below is playlist with some of my musical inspirations like Taylor Swift, Alicia Keys, Halsey, Elvis, etc. I really enjoy listening to this playlist when I go for a jog or walk around the lake near my new home. My favorite artist is Taylor Swift because she is also a songwriter and I have loved her music since I was 10 years old and first heard her song Teardrops On My Guitar. I will finally be attending her concert for the first time in my life. I will be Going to the Tampa show on August 14 and the Miami show on August 18.
