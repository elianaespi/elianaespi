## About Me

My name is Eliana Espinosa.I am 21 years old, I'm a cancer survivor (so is my mom and her mom), and I was born in Brooklyn, NY but was raised in Miami, FL. As a Math major, i have worked on several projects with R programming language and you can see them by clicking on the Projects tab. When I am not working or studying I like to write lyrics about different experiences in life. I have been writing for about 3 years  and my best song ideas tend to come to me late at night when I am trying to fall asleep. 


## Musical Inspirations

Below is playlist with some of my musical inspirations like Taylor Swift, Alicia Keys, Halsey, Elvis, etc. I really enjoy listening to this playlist when I go for a jog or walk around the lake near my new home. My favorite artist is Taylor Swift because she is also a songwriter and I have loved her music since I was 10 years old and first heard her song Teardrops On My Guitar.After being a Taylor Swift fan for 11 years, I was finally able to see her perform twice in August 14 (Tampa, FL) and August 18, 2018. IT was an amazing experience and if I could keep attending more of her concerts I definitely would! I highly suggest to anyone that they should attend the Reputation Stadium Tour.
